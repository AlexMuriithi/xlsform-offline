			<b>ODK XLSForm Offline</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			ODK XLSForm Offline is an app for Windows and Mac that converts data collection forms created with the <a href="http://xlsform.org">XLSForm standard</a> into XForms that ODK Collect or ODK Aggregate need. Once converted, it also validates that the XForm will run perfectly with all ODK tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			ODK XLSForm Offline does not need an Internet connection, so it's always available, very fast, and easy to use. Just choose an Excel file and press the Run button to get an ODK-ready XForm.
